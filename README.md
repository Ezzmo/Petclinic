## Introduction 
### Project Brief
The general outline of this project was to use all the concepts from previous training modules to plan, design and implement a solution for automating the deployments and development workflows for the projects that are linked below: 
 
**Frontend client using AngularJS** https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-angular
 
 **API using Java** https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-rest
 

 
As a group of 4 individuals we would have to either use the tools we had been taught during our training such as **Terraform, Kubernetes, Ansible** or utilise other tools that would work in a similar fashion to these justifying why they would be the most preferable for deployment. 

The deployment of this project would require automated building and re-deployment to testing and live environments upon any GitHub changes, whilst also keeping track of running costs.

## Planning

As this is a group project composed of 4 members, there will need to be adequate planning measures in place so that all individuals can work efficiently and coherently towards the main goal which is the successful deployment of the application.  

Therefore, throughout the duration of this project we chose to employ **Scrum** as our project management framework. Unlike conventional methods of project planning, Scrum promotes and encourages teams to learn through experiences, self-organise and share ideas whilst working towards resolving a problem.

This short video further explains the benifits of using **SCRUM**

<a name="UserCases"></a>
## User Cases
Developer:

•	I need the tests to be automatically begin once I push my changes to a repo and be able to monitor the results/progress.

•	Successful updates need to be deployed to production with little to no downtime.


Engineer:

•	As an engineer, I need to be able to monitor the pipeline, regarding costs, networks and health of deployment.


User:

•	I need access to the web-app and trust that any information stored is secure.
